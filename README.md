**Welcome to my machine learning project repository!**

=> This space showcases the skills and knowledge I've gained while learning through the Google Machine Learning Crash Course. Each project here is 

carefully designed to reflect real-world ML applications, with a focus on both technical accuracy and practical understanding.


=> I've made sure not just to build models, but to understand why and how they work—covering data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model 

selection, training, evaluation, and interpretability. The goal is to present clean, insightful projects that show a complete ML pipeline—from raw 

data to predictions—using industry-standard tools and best practices.


=> This repository reflects my hands-on learning journey with Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, and visualization libraries, all backed by solid 

theoretical understanding from the Google ML course. All code and documentation are written with clarity and scalability in mind, as if preparing 

for a real internship or production-ready environment.
