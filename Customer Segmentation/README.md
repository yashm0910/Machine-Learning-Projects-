# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## Project Overview
A simple yet effective implementation of customer segmentation using K-Means clustering. This project demonstrates how unsupervised learning can be used to group retail customers based on their spending habits and visit frequency for targeted marketing strategies.

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing with StandardScaler
- Optimal cluster detection using the Elbow Method
- Visualization of customer segments
- Business interpretation of clusters
- Actionable marketing insights

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Installation
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script
3. Review the generated segmentation plots and insights

### Data Enhancements
- Incorporate more customer attributes (age, location, product preferences)
- Use real-world retail datasets from sources like:
  - UCI Machine Learning Repository
  - Kaggle retail datasets

### Algorithm Improvements
- Experiment with other clustering algorithms:
  - DBSCAN for density-based clustering
  - Hierarchical clustering
- Add silhouette analysis for cluster validation
- Implement automated K-selection using gap statistics

### Visualization Upgrades
- 3D plots for datasets with 3+ dimensions
- Interactive plots using Plotly or Bokeh
- Parallel coordinates plot for multi-dimensional analysis
- Cluster comparison dashboards
